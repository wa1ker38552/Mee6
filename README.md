# Mee6
Mee6 grinder 5.0

Changes from 4.0 -> Optimized for use on multiple accounts, each run is a different thread. Everything is randomized even MORE and default randomization is much harder to detect. Everything is written more concisely and easier to understand. Setup is much easier.

This current version has been running on Scriptly for several months now and earns on average maybe 500+ xp each day. You can obviously toggle the settings to earn thousands of xp each day but that would make it much easier to detect. You can config the settings dynamically using the `mee6.Config` module or change the defualt values in `mee6/config.py`

To setup, just put in the channel for counting and economy, and put in your token. If hosting using Replit, the program will also run a Flask application so that your program gets pinged.
